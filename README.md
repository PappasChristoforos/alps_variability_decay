# Cross-scale variability analysis of tree ecophysiological time series.

Codes from:

## Pappas et al., (2020), *Linking variability of tree water use and growth with species resilience to environmental changes.* Ecography, doi: 10.1111/ecog.04968

Folder **Code** includes the R scripts for calculating the cross-scale variability decay patterns of (1) meteorological data (file ‘METEO_Ltal.R’), (2) stem dendrometer data (file ‘DENDROMETERS_Ltal.R’), (3) sap flow (file ‘SAPFLOW_Ltal.R’), (4) tree rings (files ‘TRW_Ltal.R’ and ‘TRW_Europe.R’), and for comparing and illustrating the results (file ‘SLOPE_COMPARISON_all_variables.R’)
